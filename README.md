# Apprentice-Challenge
Challenges used to test Apprentices on C#.  
Read, Study and Practice the provided tutorials. After that come here and try yourlef on our Challanges.
When you have finished the Apprentice's challenge please move forward to the next level.


## What an Apprentice should know?
There is not a simple and definitive answer for this kind of question.  
We try our best to prepare the basic foundation that will help people that are starting on development to learn the basics and have some fun along the way but our primary focus is to develop useful skills based on industry necessities. Taking that in consideration we excpect an Apprentice to know:
* CSharp basic keywords
* Some basic language types (char, string, int, bool)
* Basic work with the Console API (Read/Write)
* Conditional Statements
